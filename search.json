For the closest lunch or dinner options within around five minutes of campus, we recommend the following:\n\nBloomsbury Farmers’ Market (Thursday only) – a big favourite with everybody in the office. Taking place in Torrington Square from around 12–2pm every Thursday, there are usually over 20 stalls selling a huge range of cuisines. Prices generally fall just under &lt;£10.\nRoti King – very tasty Malaysian and Singaporean street food. You can’t book here, and queues often form outside if you want a table, but it’s worth it. You can pre-order and collect, or they will also deliver to UCL. Prices for main dishes range from £5–10.\nNoodle & Snack 面道坊 - amazing handmade noodles and broths! The restaurant is small, and it can get very busy around lunch and dinner if you’re hoping to sit in, but they also do takeaway. A main and a side should cost £10–20.\nFranco Manca – Good quality sourdough pizzas for &lt;£10. Both eat in and takeaway options are available.\nRosa’s Thai – A large selection of tasty Thai dishes with a sizeable number of vegetarian and vegan options. Lunch will likely cost £10–20 per person. Eat in and takeaway options are available.\nMestizo – delicious Mexican food with a large number of items on the menu. Expect a meal for one to cost around £20."

As well as the usual sandwiches and salads, this café also serves a few cooked options such as pasta dishes.\nGordon’s Café (8am–7pm) – Similar to George Farha, but with the bonus addition of pizza!\nWilkins Terrace and Lower Refectory (8–10:30am, 11:30am–7pm) – located on the lower level of campus, the canteen houses 3 or 4 different outlets selling a variety of cooked dishes."

To study such patterns, fossil occurrence data are typically binned into latitudinal bins (e.g. palaeoverse::lat_bins and palaeoverse::bin_lat). At the equator, a degree of longitude is the same as a degree of latitude, approximately 111 km. However, this length decreases as you move away from the equator. Consequently, standard latitudinal bins (e.g. 5º bins) have an unequal amount of area within each bin.\n\n\nObjective\n\nDevelop a function (e.g. lat_bins) which creates equal-area latitudinal bins\n\n\n\nStarting points to consider\n\nHow might users want to define their bins? Number of bins or size of bins?\nDo users want the entire latitudinal range?\nWhat output might users want?\nThe Earth is not a perfect sphere\nThe distribution of land and ocean area changes through time"
