# Briefs

We have prepared four project briefs for the hackathon. You and your group are free to choose whichever brief you wish to work on (first-come, first-served basis). Alternatively, you are free to work on your own project idea.

## Brief 1: geo_check

### Context

When working with fossil datasets, we typically use age information associated with occurrences. This age information can be numerical values, interval names, or in some cases, a mixture of both. As with all datasets, errors and inconsistencies can exist.

### Objective

* Develop a function (e.g. `geo_check`) which delivers automatic checking (and potentially cleaning) for common errors and inconsistencies in age data.

### Starting points to consider

* How is the data structured? One (e.g. early_interval/late_interval) or two data columns (e.g. max_ma and min_ma)?
* What data errors might arise (e.g. spelling mistakes, data in the wrong columns)?
* What inconsistencies might arise (e.g. "early interval" vs. "early_interval")?
